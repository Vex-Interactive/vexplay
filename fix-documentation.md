### 3. Login Dialog Positioning Fix

### 4. Authentication System Implementation
- Created comprehensive Firebase authentication system
- Implemented login, signup, and guest login functionality
- Added user session management using localStorage
- Created premium content protection for registered users
- Added protection layers:
  - Path-based protection to prevent direct URL access
  - Visual UI protection with blurred thumbnails and lock icons
  - Game page protection to prevent unauthorized access to premium games

### Authentication System Details
1. **User Authentication Files:**
   - `/storage/js/auth.js` - Core authentication functions and UI elements
   - `/storage/js/path-protection.js` - URL-based protection for premium content
   - `/storage/js/premium-check.js` - Early checking of premium content access
   - `/storage/js/game-protection.js` - Protection for premium game pages

2. **Premium Content Protection:**
   - Protected games are marked with the 'premium-content' class
   - Content is visually indicated with blur effects and lock icons
   - Direct URL access is blocked for non-registered users
   - Login prompts guide users to register or sign in

3. **User Interface:**
   - Login/Signup pages for account creation and authentication
   - User session info displayed after login
   - Visual indicators for premium content

4. **Automation:**
   - `add-protection.js` script to add protection to all premium game HTML files

### How to Add New Premium Games
1. Add the game path to the `premiumGamePaths` array in `games/index.html`
2. Add the game folder name to the `premiumPaths` array in `path-protection.js`
3. Add the game folder name to the `premiumGames` array in `add-protection.js`
4. Run the `add-protection.js` script to add protection to the game HTML files

### How Authentication Works
1. User registers or logs in through Firebase authentication
2. User session data is stored in localStorage
3. When accessing premium content:
   - System checks if user is logged in and not a guest
   - If authorized, content is displayed normally
   - If unauthorized, protection systems prevent access and show login prompts
