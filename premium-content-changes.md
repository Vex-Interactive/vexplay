# Premium Content Protection Updates

## Overview
The premium content protection system has been updated to follow these rules:
1. All games past line 490 in games/index.html are now premium-only content
2. Games before line 490 that were previously premium are now free
3. Premium content access now redirects to the login page instead of showing popups or blocking access directly
4. Logged-in users (non-guests) will see premium content without blur effects or lock icons

## Implementation Details

### Visual Changes
- Premium content in the game listings shows blur effects and lock icons only for guests and non-logged-in users
- Registered users (non-guests) see all content normally without visual restrictions
- Clicking on premium content redirects directly to the login page with a redirect URL parameter (for guests/non-logged-in users)
- After successful login, users will be automatically redirected back to the content they were trying to access

### Technical Implementation
1. `auth.js` - Modified to:
   - Redirect to login.html instead of displaying popups
   - Only apply visual restrictions if user is not logged in or is a guest
2. `game-protection.js` - Updated to redirect to login page with redirect parameters
3. `path-protection.js` - Updated comments to reflect new line 490 threshold
4. `premium-check.js` - Modified to redirect instead of showing blocking screens
5. `games/index.html` - Updated to mark games past line 490 as premium

### How It Works
- When someone tries to access premium content:
  - If logged in as a registered user: Full access is granted with no visual restrictions
  - If logged in as a guest or not logged in: Visual restrictions are applied and clicking redirects to login page
  - Upon successful login: Returned to the original content

## URL-based Protection
The comprehensive list of protected content paths is still maintained in `path-protection.js` to ensure protection at the URL level. This prevents direct URL access to premium content for unauthorized users.

## Running the Protection Script
The `add-protection.js` script can be run to ensure all premium game HTML files have the protection script included:

```
node add-protection.js
```

This script adds the game-protection.js reference to each premium game's HTML file.
